                <h2>About Lis Stender</h2>
                <p>
                    Lis Stender, born in 1963 with the real name being Liv Aurora Jensen, is a self-taught graphic designer with both Greenlandic and Danish roots, who modernises the Greenlandic culture. Lis is considered a pioneer by many local and international people in product design in Greenland.

                <p>
                    However, personally, she humbly calls herself a creative person - not an artist. She says"
                    I have never seen myself as an artist, not really, it is just something that happened to me through time that people have started calling me an artist. But I am not educated as an artist. I am not a fancy artist with fancy schools. I am just learning by doing". However, from 2018 she has been studying fashion design at the Copenhagen Academy of Fashion Design to pursue her dream of becoming a fashion designer</p>
                <p>
                    As Lis emphasizes, everything she does is rooted in her belief that it is important to know where we come from and what is our culture and heritage. However, heritage shouldn’t only be something hidden away in museums. Our culture has to be retold over and over again and applied for everyday use.
                    <br><br>
                    Below you will find a video which goes more in depth about Lis' philosophy in life.

                <p> "The design is an interconnection of the past, present and future; the young and the old; the men and the women; Greenlandic and International cultures.

                    The design creates a powerfull emotion
                    by expressing an artistic beauty
                    in useful objects of Greenlands everyday life.
